This research is about
modelling a flow simulation of a 1D Poiseuille model using Python code. The
Poiseuille 1D model is based on Poiseuille’s law, which is an equation that
describes how blood flow rate is related to different factors such as length
and radius of the artery, viscosity of the blood. Many heart diseases arise from
the lack of proper blood circulation: from atherosclerosis and strokes to
malfunctions in organs. Understanding how the blood flow is impacted by
pressure, viscosity, length, and diameter of the artery is essential to treating
and preventing these diseases. To understand blood flow, renown physician Jean
Marie Poiseuille derived Poiseuille’s law which describes how the rate of the
flow of blood  changes as viscosity , change in pressure , radius R , and
length of the artery.

In this research, Python code is developed
to visualize the simulation of a 1D Poiseuille model that helps us visualize
how each of these variables alters the flow of blood.   

Matplotlib was used for visualizing results.
